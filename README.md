# Backend Engineering Concepts Documentation

### 1.Core Technologies

## Python
    • General-purpose language widely used in backend development.
        # Features:
            o	Easy-to-read syntax.
            o	Extensive libraries (e.g., requests, asyncio, pandas).
            o	Strong community support.
            •	Backend usage: Data processing, API development, automation, scripting.

## Django
    • High-level Python web framework for rapid development.
        # Features:
            o	Built-in ORM for database interaction.
            o	MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture.
            o	User authentication and admin interface.
            o	Middleware support for request/response processing.
            •	Use cases: Building scalable web applications, content management systems, APIs.

## REST APIs
    • Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for APIs.
        # Principles:
            o	Stateless communication.
            o	CRUD operations mapped to HTTP methods:
                	GET → Read
                	POST → Create
                	PUT/PATCH → Update
                	DELETE → Remove
            o	Resource-based endpoints (e.g., /users/1).
        # Benefits:
            o	Simplicity.
            o	Widely adopted and supported.
        # Example:
            GET /products → fetch all products.

## GraphQL
    • Query language for APIs developed by Facebook.
        # Features:
            o	Client specifies required data (avoids over/under fetching).
            o	Strongly typed schema.
            o	Single endpoint for all operations.
        # Operations:
            o	Query (read).
            o	Mutation (write/update).
            o	Subscription (real-time updates).
        # Benefits:
            o	Efficient data fetching.
            o	Flexible API evolution.

## Docker
    • Containerization platform for packaging applications.
        # Features:
            o	Consistency across environments (dev, test, production).
            o	Lightweight compared to virtual machines.
            o	Easy deployment with Dockerfiles and images.
        # Components:
            o	Dockerfile – instructions for building images.
            o	Images – packaged applications.
            o	Containers – running instances of images.
        # Use cases: Microservices, CI/CD, reproducible builds.
        
## CI/CD Pipelines
    • Continuous Integration (CI):
        o	Automates building and testing applications.
        o	Ensures code quality before merging.
    • Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):
        o	Automates deployment to staging/production.
    • Tools:
        o	GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI.
    • Typical stages:
        1.	Code Checkout.
        2.	Build & Test.
        3.	Linting & Code Quality Checks.
        4.	Dockerization.
        5.	Deployment (to servers, Kubernetes, or cloud platforms).


### 2. Advanced Backend Concepts

## Database Design
    • Process of structuring data in a database.
        # Principles:
            o	Normalization: Reduce redundancy (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).
            o	Denormalization: Optimize for performance (in some cases).
            o	Primary/Foreign Keys: Relationships between tables.
            o	Indexes: Speed up queries.
        # Types:
            o	Relational Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL).
            o	NoSQL Databases (MongoDB, Redis).
        # Best practices:
            o	Use meaningful table/column names.
            o	Define clear relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many).
            o	Balance performance vs flexibility.

## Asynchronous Programming
    •	Execution model that allows tasks to run without blocking.
    •	Important in handling I/O-bound operations (network requests, file system access).
        # Python’s tools:
            o	async/await syntax.
            o	asyncio library.
        # Benefits:
            o	Better scalability (handle thousands of requests).
            o	Efficient resource utilization.

## Caching Strategies
    •	Technique to store frequently accessed data for fast retrieval.
        # Benefits:
            o	Reduced latency.
            o	Lower database load.
            o	Improved scalability.
            •	Levels:
            o	Client-side caching (browser, local storage).
            o	Server-side caching (Django cache framework).
            o	Database query caching (materialized views, Redis).
        # Common strategies:
            o	In-memory cache (Redis, Memcached).
            o	Write-through cache: Data written to cache and database simultaneously.
            o	Write-back cache: Data written to cache first, database updated later.
            o	Time-to-live (TTL): Expire cached items after a set duration.
            •	Best practices:
            o	Cache only what’s expensive to compute or fetch.
            o	Set appropriate expiration policies.
            o	Monitor cache hit/miss ratio.
